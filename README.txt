Code was written using Python 3.9.12 with Jupyter Notebook, and uses pickle (v4.0), numpy (v1.21.2), scipy (v1.7.1), matplotlib (v3.5.2), pandas (v1.4.2), scikit-learn (v1.0.1), seaborn (v0.11.2), biopython (v1.79), and regex (v2021.8.21).

It is presented as a series of nine consecutive Jupyter notebooks, many of which use data structures generated by previous notebooks. This code computes CRISPRi repression intensity for single sgRNA perturbations and growth rate effects for up to fourth-order CRISPRi and environmental perturbations. The code then trains and evaluate the continuous epistasis model as a methodology to predict changes to E. coli growth rate following continuous, high-order transcriptional and environmental perturbations.

If you use anaconda for package management, creating the following environment using the command line code below will ensure that each required package is installed and uses a version compatible with this our analysis. Replace <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> with your desired environment name.

conda create -n <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> python=3.9.12 numpy=1.21.2 scipy=1.7.1 matplotlib=3.5 pandas=1.4.2 scikit-learn=1.0.1 seaborn=0.11.2 biopython=1.78 openpyxl=3.0.1 regex=2022.7.9 jupyter nbconvert==5.4.1

The main purpose of this repo is to recapitulate figures and analysis from the aforementioned manuscript, however many of the functions can be referenced to apply these techniques to new data. Much of the innovation of this work is contained within the Jupyter Notebook 4_Continuous_Epistasis_Model. Within this notebook, single perturbation-growth functions are fit using scipy.optimize.curve_fit on a standard 2-parameter sigmoid. Then, coupling constants ("a-values") are trained using the following nested functions:

calc_avals				Wrapped that optimizes a pair of coupling constants for a set 					of pairwise perturbation data, given these pairwise data and 					two sets of single perturbation growth curves (in the form on 					sigmoidal parameters)

residuals_growthPairs			Calculates the residuals between true pairwise growth rates 					and predicted growth rates based on coupling constants. Also 					implements regularization of coupling constants, if desired.

pairGrowthRates				Outputs pairwise growth rate predictions based on a pair of 					"dosage" (perturbation intensities, in this case repression 					values) and a pair of coupling constants.

solveReff				Called by pairGrowthRates, this function numerically solves 					the system of equations introduced in Zimmer et al. 2016 					(Equation 3 in Otto et al. 2023).

calc_pair_gr				Once coupling constants are solved, this function can be used 					to recreate pairwise landscapes based on perturbation 						intensities and coupling constants.

For those looking for machine-readable growth rate and [mRNA] measurements following CRISPRi, download Supplementary_Tables.xlsx (in this directory). This file contains all qPCR data (Table S1) and all growth rate measurements (Tables Extra 1 - Extra 4) from the initial pairwise CRISPRi screen (Extra 1), the pathway CRISPRi screen (Extra 2), the third-order CRISPRi screen (Extra 3), and the gene-by-environment screen (Extra 4).
